# Self-balancing Motorcycle
 Control System Design for a Self-balancing Motorcycle

This project focuses on designing, testing, and implementing an autonomous or remote control system for a self-balancing motorcycle using the Arduino Engineering Kit. The aim is to create a digital motor controller that effectively balances and steers the motorcycle, which can be demonstrated on the provided hardware.

## Features:
- Autonomous or remote control capabilities
- Digital motor controller design
- Balancing and steering control
- Live demonstration of the system on the motorcycle hardware

## Components:
- Self-balancing Motorcycle Kit
- CAD components (provided in the lab course files in the coursework_group directory)
- Simulink starter models (provided in the lab course files in the coursework_group directory)
- Motorcycle hardware for testing and demonstration purposes

## Software Requirements
- MATLAB and Simulink (latest version recommended)
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino support package for MATLAB and Simulink
